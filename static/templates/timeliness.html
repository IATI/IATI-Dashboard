            <p>This table seeks to measure how often a publisher updates their data. There is no simple answer as to what constitutes an update. Can any trivial edit be regarded as an update? As transactions are the most numerous element reported in IATI the adopted methodology assumes that a publisher has updated their data if a transaction with a more recent transaction date than previously published is detected across the publisher's entire portfolio. </p>

            <p>The table records the number of days in each of the last twelve months on which the most recently recorded transaction date was observed by the Dashboard to have changed. (The current month is also displayed for informational purposes, but is not used in the assessment.) </p>

        <p>The frequency statistics attempt to assess how often any part of a publisher's data is substantively updated.</p>

        <p>For the purposes of these statistics an update is assumed to have taken place on any given day when the most recently recorded transaction date across a publisher's entire portfolio is observed to have changed to a more recent date. This approach has been adopted as transactions are the most numerous and most frequently updated elements in the reporting of activities.</p>

        <p>The table of statistics records the number of days in each of the last twelve calendar months (the current month is also displayed for informational purposes, but is not used in the assessment) on which the most recently recorded transaction date was observed by the Dashboard to have changed. The Dashboard maintains a statistical snapshot of each day, which allows for this data to be recalculated using historical recordings.</p>

            <p>Future transaction dates disrupt these statistics. For example a publisher might today report a transaction date for each month for the next year and never refresh their data. Over the next year, as each of these future dates move into the past, the statistics would incorrectly give the publisher a frequency assessment of monthly, even though they did not refresh their data.</p>

            <p><strong>Future transaction dates may affect the assessments on this page</strong>. Publishers who currently have future transaction dates have a <span style="background-color: #f2aaaa">red flag</span> next to their assessment. A <span style="background-color: #fcf8aa">yellow flag</span> indicates that although a publisher does not currently have future transactions, they did report future transactions at some point over the last twelve calendar months.</p>

            <p>In our further work on this dashboard page, we plan to exclude activities in which future transactions dates are reported from these assessments until such time that a publisher's entire portfolio no longer contains any future dates.</s></p>

        <p>In the original Indicator methodology the IATI Registry log dates were analysed to assess when updates had been made. This approach was flawed as the Registry logs record any change, no matter how trivial. A spelling correction, for example, would count as an update. Similarly if a publisher's file was inaccessible, its reappearance would count as an update.</p>

<pre>
For data captured each day over the past year
    For each transaction (of any type) in the publisher's data
        Get the transaction date as follows:
            If transaction-date exists
                If transaction-date/@iso-date exists
                    Use transaction-date/@iso-date

                Use value/@value-date
            Else the transaction is ignore
        Parse the start of the transaction date as an iso date (yyyy-mm-dd...).
            If it does not match, the transaction is ignored.
        Store a record of this transaction date.
    Of the recorded dates, find the latest date that is on or before the date the data was captured.
    Record this date against the date of data capture
previous transaction date = 0001-01-01
Loop over the list of dates
    If transaction date > previous transaction date
        previous transaction date = transaction date
        Record an update as having happened on this day
Count the updates by calendar month
