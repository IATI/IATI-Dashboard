        <p>Developing countries have, since 2008, been asking their development partners to provide forward-looking data which can be used for both planning and budget preparation. While aggregated country-level budgets have a certain political value it is activity-level data that is of greatest benefit, and which this dimension attempts to assess.</p>
        <p>The standard asks publishers to break down their total commitment to an activity into annual or quarterly budgets - i.e. the sum of the reported budgets matches the sum of commitments. It is stressed that these budget breakdowns are indicative and are in no way binding.</p>
        <p>This assessment counts the number of current activities for this and the next two years that contain budgets. It is based on a number of assumptions:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>For any given future year all current activities should contain a budget.</li>
        <li><strong>Activities are deemed to be current in any given year if their end date is reported to be in this year or beyond (or if there is no end date)</strong></li>
        <li>Counting the number of activities that contain budgets provides a fairer result than summing the value of these budgets. The proportion of a publisher's total commitment for a future year that has already been committed to existing projects may vary greatly (e.g. you may have earmarked an amount to spend in three-years’ time, but not yet agreed on how to spend it.)</li>
        <li>For publisher's reporting multiple hierarchical levels ONLY the level that budgets are reported at is used in this calculation. However if budgets are reported at multiple levels, all activities are counted, and the publisher is marked with a red flag.</li>

        <p>No separate assessment is provided as the percentage of current activities containing budgets for this and the next two years is the de facto assessment. No attempt is currently being made to turn these into a descriptive summary (as, for example, "Frequency = "Monthly"). The percentage for the middle year (i.e. 'next year') is of most relevance to developing countries.</p>

        <p>This methodology differs substantially from the original GP Indicator in two ways.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong><em>All</em> current</strong></em> activities are assessed, NOT only those containing Country Programmable Aid. CPA is calculated by the Forward Spending Survey by excluding activities based on a complex filtering of purpose codes, finance types and aid types. Firstly this is difficult to explain. Secondly the provision, or lack thereof, of forward looking data is not believed to be determined by CPA status. Thirdly, as a multi-stakeholder standard many IATI publishers, in particular implementing agencies, do not necessarily report CRS-specific fields.</li>
        <li>As explained above the <em><strong>number of activities</strong></em> with budgets, NOT the value of budgets is counted.</li>

    <p>For the purpose of this calculation, each <code>iati-activity</code> XML block is an activity.</p>

    <p>To test whether an activity is current in a given year:</p>

<pre>
end dates =
    For each activity-date that describes an end date (type is end-planned or end-actual in 1.xx, 3 or 4 in 2.xx)
        Parse activity-date/@iso-date as an iso date ('yyyy-mm-dd...')
        If this does not work parse activity-date/text() as an iso date ('yyyy-mm-dd...')
        If neither work, ignore this activity-date
If no end dates were successfully parsed
    The activity is current
Else
    If there is an end date where (date year >= given year)
        The activity is current
    Else
        The activity is not current
</pre>

    <p>To find the year for a budget:</p>

<pre>
start = 
    Parse period-start/@iso-date as an iso date ('yyyy-mm-dd...')
    If this does not work parse period-start/text() as an iso date ('yyyy-mm-dd...')
    Otherwise null
end =
    Parse period-end/@iso-date as an iso date ('yyyy-mm-dd...')
    If this does not work parse period-end/text() as an iso date ('yyyy-mm-dd...')
    Otherwise null

If start and end are both not null 
    If (end - start <= 370 days)
        If end month >= 7
            budget year = end year
        Else
            budget year = end year - 1
    Else ignore the budget
Else budget year is null
</pre>

    <p>The relevant hierarchical level is:</p>

<pre>
If the @hierarchy attribute is missing the hierarchy value is 1
Else the hierarchy value is the value of the @hierarchy attribute

If all budgets for current activities in the given years have the same hierarchy value
    Only activities with that hierarchy value are at a relevant hierarchical level
Else
    All activities are considered to be at a relevant hierarchical level
</pre>
    
    <p>To calculate the "Current activities" column, count the number of activities that are:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>at a relevant hierarchical level (see above)</li>
        <li>AND current</li>
        </ul>
    <p>To calculate the "Current activities with budgets" column, count the number of activities that are:
        <ul>
        <li>at a relevant hierarchical level (see above)</li>
        <li>AND current</li>
        <li>AND contain at least one budget budget with a budget year (as desribed above) that matches the year of the column</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
