How to contribute code and documents
====================================

How we use branches in this repository
--------------------------------------

* master represents our main development branch
* live is the branch we are currently using for our deployed instance of the code
* Other branches represent development work or bug fixes.

Submitting changes
------------------

* Fork this repository (if you haven't previously)
* Make sure you're working on top of an up to date copy of IATI's master branch
    - Create a branch named after the work you're doing (if you're targeting a specific issue, start the branch name with the issue number e.g. ``42-feature-name``)
* Do your work
    - If your work addresses a specific issue, reference that issue in your commit message by starting the commit message with ``[#issue number]`` e.g. ``[#64]``
* Create a pull request

Specific Tasks:
===============

Deployment
----------
If you find any issues in deploying your own version of the code we'd love to hear about it and try to improve our deployment documentation.

User Interface
--------------
Can you improve the user interface? Can you make it look 'nicer'?

Documentation
-------------
We would welcome any improvements to how the code or the application is documented.

Statistics
----------
Can you check that the generated statstics are telling us what we think they are telling us?
Do you have other tests/statistics that we could be generating?

Unit Tests
----------
Can you improve the unit testing to make deployment more robust?

Fix a Bitesize issue
--------------------
We mark some of issues as 'Bitesize'. Generally these will help ease you into the code and help you find your way around.
