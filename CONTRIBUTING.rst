Deployment
----------
If you find any issues in deploying your own version fo the code we'd love to hear about it and try to improve our documentation.

User Interface
--------------
Can you improve the user interface? Can you make it look 'nicer'?

Statistics
----------
Can you check that the generated statstics are telling us what we think they are telling us?
Do you have other tests/statistics that we could be generating?

Fix a Bitesize issue
--------------------
We mark some of issues as 'Bitesize'. Generally these will help ease you into the code and help you find your way around.
