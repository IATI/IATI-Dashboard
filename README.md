## Summary

 Product  |  IATI Dashboard
--- | ---
Description | A Django web application that provides key numbers, statistics and graphs about the data on the [IATI registry](http://iatiregistry.org/).  This repository is currently a development version where the IATI Dashboard/Publishing Statistics and Code for IATI Analytics are being merged.
Website |  Development only; see [IATI Dashboard](https://dashboard.iatistandard.org), and [Code for IATI Analytics](https://analytics.codeforiati.org) for live versions. 
Related | Repositories for the [live version of the IATI Dashboard](https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Dashboard), [live version of the IATI Publishing Stats](https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Publishing-Statistics), and [Code for IATI Analytics](https://github.com/codeforIATI/analytics).  Data is generated from [Code for IATI Stats](https://github.com/codeforIATI/IATI-Stats).

## High-level requirements

* Python 3.12
* Unix-based setup (e.g., Linux, MacOS X) with `bash`, `wget` and `curl` installed.
* Development files for libfreetype, libpng, libxml and libxslt e.g. ``libfreetype6-dev libpng-dev libxml2-dev libxslt-dev``.

## Running the app locally
### Overview
The IATI Dashboard is mostly written in Python but also has some helper Bash scripts to collect the data that the dashboard uses.  Top-level steps required to run the Dashboard are:

1. Setup Python environment and install dependencies.
2. Fetch the data.
3. Build the static graphs and other data that will be served via the Dashboard.
4. Run the web server.

Paths to different directories are set in `./src/config.py`.

### 1. Setup environment

Assuming that this repository has been cloned and you are in the root directory of the repository.

```
# Setup and activate a virtual environment (recommended) - here we use virtualenv
virtualenv ve
source ve/bin/activate
```

Now install the dependencies.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Fetching the data

Bash scripts are used to fetch the data that the Dashboard will present.  They will store data in `./data` and `./stats-calculated`.

```
# Fetch the necessary calculated stats
./get_stats.sh

# Fetch some extra data from github and github gists and other sources on the internet
./fetch_data.sh
```

### 3. Build static data and graphs and copy to static

```
mkdir out
cd src
python make_plots.py
python make_csv.py
python speakers_kit.py
cp ../out/data static/
cp ../img/aggregate static/
cp ../img/publishers static/
```

### 4. Run the webserver.

From `./src/`:

```
python manage.py runserver
```

The Dashboard will now be accessible from `localhost:8000/`.


## Development

### Calculating your own statistics

The IATI Dashboard requires a `stats-calculated` directory, which can be downloaded using the `get_stats.sh` shell script as described above.  This can also be calculated using [Code for IATI Stats](http://github.com/codeforIATI/IATI-Stats) where `stats-calculated` corresponds to the `gitout` directory generated by [`git.sh` in IATI-Stats](https://github.com/codeforIATI/IATI-Stats#running-for-every-commit-in-the-data-directory).

Often you only want to regenerate the current stats, use `get_stats.sh` to download the pre-calculated historical stats and just replace the `stats-calculated/current directory` with the `out` directory produced by running the [loop, aggregate and invert commands individually](https://github.com/codeforIATI/IATI-Stats#getting-started), then regenerate graphs and CSV files as per the above.

### Adding new dependencies

If a change requires new dependencies then please add to `requirements.in` or `requirements_dev.in` as appropriate and recompile:

```
pip-compile requirements_dev.in
pip-compile requirements.in
```

### Linting

Code linting is carried out using [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) and `setup.cfg` has the configuration.
