<p>The statistics on IATI data that are calculated routinely and displayed on this dashboard are now a central part of the service that the Technical Team provides to publishers and users of IATI data alike: for publishers to better understand how to improve their data; for users to assess which data is likely to meet their particular needs; and for the technical team itself to prioritise its commitments to data quality.</p>

<p>It is also important that a consistent approach is developed in the presentation of statistics in IATI's annual report and the Dashboard's own calculations, as well as when IATI is asked to contribute to monitoring reports. This section of the Dashboard is focused to do just that.</p>

<p>Each of the pages in this section contains:</p>

<ul>
<li>a non-technical narrative explaining the thinking and methodology behind each dimension</li>
<li>a link to the IATI Consultation Forum where the methodology can be queried or challenged</li>
<li>pseudo-code, for technical readers, to explain in more detail the machine logic involved</li>
<li>a table of statistics - for all IATI publishers - that are used to derive an assessment</li>
<li>an assessment that interprets the statistics into a meaningful summary</li>
</ul>

<p>The statistics on these pages are refreshed frequently. The methodology is open to inspection and will be changed in response to feedback and discussion.</p>

<p>The overriding concern of the Technical Team is that the methodologies being tested here gain buy-in from our members and publishers so that they can be used as a credible benchmark in improving the quality of IATI data.</p>
