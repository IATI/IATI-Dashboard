<p>This section of the IATI Dashboard tracks published IATI data around a series of quality measures.</p> 
<p>These are specifically technical measures - schema validation, download issues, XML formatting, etc - that can be easily rectified by publishers.  No attempt is made to evaluate the actual content of the data - the dashboard should be used for sense checking and technical fixes.</p>
