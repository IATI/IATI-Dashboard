# Contributing

If you would like to contribute to the IATI Dashboard you can....

* Send us feedback about your user experience. You can find our [contact details on the IATI Organisation page on GitHub](https://github.com/IATI)
* Report bugs
* Request new features
* Contribute code or documents to improve the application. See the list of specific tasks below.


## How to report a bug or request a feature

If you are able to work with GitHub then please [create an issue](https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Dashboard/issues/new/choose).

Before creating a new issue [check to see if the issue already exists](https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Dashboard/issues/). If not then please do create it.

If you are not comfortable working with GitHub, but would still like to contribute, then talk to us. You can reach us via the central [IATI Developer Documentation pages](https://iatistandard.org/en/guidance/developer/).


## How to contribute code and documents

### How we use branches in this repository

* `live` represents the branch we are currently using for our deployed instance of the code.
* Eventually a `develop` branch will be for development work that is not yet live.
* Other branches represent development work or bug fixes.

### Submitting changes

* Fork this repository (if you haven't previously)
* Make sure you're working on top of an up to date copy of the `live` branch
* Create a branch named after the work you're doing (if you're targeting a specific issue, start the branch name with the issue number e.g. `42-feature-name`).
* Do your work, creating atomic commits as you go.  If your work addresses a specific issue, reference that issue in your commit message using the full URL to the issue.  Please name your commits starting with a one-word description of the commit, e.g., *fix*, *update*, *refactor*.
* Create a pull request against `develop`.

## Specific Tasks:

### Deployment

If you find any issues in deploying your own version of the code we'd love to hear about it and try to improve our deployment documentation.

### User Interface

Can you improve the user interface? Can you make it look 'nicer'?

### Documentation

We would welcome any improvements to how the code or the application is documented.

### Statistics

Can you check that the generated statstics are telling us what we think they are telling us?
Do you have other tests/statistics that we could be generating?

### Unit Tests

Can you improve the unit testing to make deployment more robust?

## Talk to us
