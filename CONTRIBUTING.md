## How to contribute code and documents

### How we use branches in this repository

* `main` represents our main development branch, and is the branch we are currently using for our deployed instance of the code
* Other branches represent development work or bug fixes.

### Submitting changes

* Fork this repository (if you haven't previously)
* Make sure you're working on top of an up to date copy of the `main` branch
    - Create a branch named after the work you're doing (if you're targeting a specific issue, start the branch name with the issue number e.g. `42-feature-name`)
* Do your work
    - If your work addresses a specific issue, reference that issue in your commit message by starting the commit message with `[#issue number]` e.g. `[#64]`
* Create a pull request against `main`

## Specific Tasks:

### Deployment

If you find any issues in deploying your own version of the code we'd love to hear about it and try to improve our deployment documentation.

### User Interface

Can you improve the user interface? Can you make it look 'nicer'?

### Documentation

We would welcome any improvements to how the code or the application is documented.

### Statistics

Can you check that the generated statstics are telling us what we think they are telling us?
Do you have other tests/statistics that we could be generating?

### Unit Tests

Can you improve the unit testing to make deployment more robust?

### Fix a Bitesize issue

We mark some of issues as 'Bitesize'. Generally these will help ease you into the code and help you find your way around.
